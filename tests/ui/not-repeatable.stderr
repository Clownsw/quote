  = note: the method `quote_into_iter` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
          `&Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `&Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
          `Ipv4Addr: ToTokens`
          which is required by `Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepToTokensExt`
          `&mut Ipv4Addr: Iterator`
          which is required by `&mut Ipv4Addr: quote::__private::ext::RepIteratorExt`
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
